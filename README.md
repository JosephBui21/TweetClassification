# TweetClassification
In this project, I entered a Kaggle Competition called "Real or Not? NLP with Disaster Tweets" where I had to clean the tweet to implement a ScikitLearn Module called "TfidfVectorizer" to convert raw text into TF-IDF to feature vectors that can be used as an input to estimate my classification.
